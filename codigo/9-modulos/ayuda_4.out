NAME
    math

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides access to the mathematical functions
    defined by the C standard.

FUNCTIONS
    acos(x, /)
        Return the arc cosine (measured in radians) of x.

        The result is between 0 and pi.

    acosh(x, /)
        Return the inverse hyperbolic cosine of x.

    asin(x, /)
        Return the arc sine (measured in radians) of x.

        The result is between -pi/2 and pi/2.

    asinh(x, /)
        Return the inverse hyperbolic sine of x.
    
    atan(x, /)
